# Angular Meteor Scrolling Pagation Prototype

A meteor project built from biolerplate from https://github.com/Urigo/angular2-meteor-base.

The master branch includes a simple table with 500 entries to act as a basecase. The following branches either use different packages or processses in order to achieve an "infinite scrolling" effect.

This branch uses the Alethes page package for meteor at https://atmospherejs.com/alethes/pages
